In spring 2018, some UVA librarians submitted a proposal to the Institute of Museum and Library Services Community Catalyst Initiative to begin planning for a collaborative and community-built equity atlas. With the support of several early partners -- The City of Charlottesville, United Way-Thomas Jefferson Area, The Adiuvans Foundation, and Smart CVille, and UVA's Initiative for the Redress of Inequity through Community Engaged Scholarship -- we received the grant!

Beginning in October 2018, we'll be working with community and university partners to understand the data and information needs of our community to increase equity.
