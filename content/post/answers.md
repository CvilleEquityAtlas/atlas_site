To add a post, we need to first add it in atlas_site/content/post/new-post.md. Then regenerate the webiste by running the command `hugo` in the terminal (within the atlas_site folder). Then go ahead and git add . the files, git commit -m "appropriate message", and git push origin master. But this only updates the site code in the atlas_site repo (github.com/CvilleEquityAtlas/atlas_site)

To update the generated site, we cd into the public folder, and git add . the files, git commit -m "appropriate message", and git push origin master again (this pushes to github.com/CvilleEquityAtlas/CvilleEquityAtlas.github.io).

So not as simple as I'd hoped for non-github users...
